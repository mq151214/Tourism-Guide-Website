    <div class="description">
        Ranked 5th by The Guardian as one of the top attractions of Pakistan. This is one is a treat, one that would compel you to pat your eyes twice to acknowledge reality or that it isn't a dream. Words can hardly be just to this place's attraction. The sea green, clear as crystal, freezing water surface amid gigantic glaciers is one part of it. A classic fable goes about this area of a prince and a fairy queen still residing and dancing above water surface every month on 14th of lunar calendar. Should you get along with a local inhabitant by chance, they would certainly run you through this tale</div>
    <div class="heading2">
        <h2>Nathiagali</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="aa">
        <img src=".\pics\kpk\Nathia gali.jpg" alt="loading" width="850" height="500">
    </div><br>
    <div class="description">
        You must have heard about this one a lot. It is more about seeing this one rather, anyway. It is simply said that this area is a maze of scenic beauty. It's a host of hiking and great weather that is a lot cooler because of its magnificent altitude. Nathiagali is located midway and an hour's drive away from Abbottabad and Murree; double the time if you're driving from Islamabad. Head out during May, June, July, and August, it would be best suited, since during these months the temperature is tolerable for a visitor generally in KPK. However, when you hear about fog here, take your steps back because visibility is reduced to a few feet only. Nothing like your hometowns fog. Top attractions Pakistan can be scattered in hazards.

    <div class="description">
        Presenting nature; nothing like anything or anywhere you have seen before. Known to be the second highest hill of Galyat and located in the hilly areas of Abbottabad. Although there is an arduous journey of nearly 3 hours to the top, which takes your breath away ascend like you have never had experienced before. Another trek follows from Dungagali to Mushkpuri, however, this one is more amiable and boasts an appealing sight of Ayubia National Park in KPK. Must explore the water pond at the top which casts a remarkable reflection of sky and trees. That is not it yet because a beautiful sight of Kashmir valley can also be seen from Mushkpuri top. So, basically, not only this breathtaking location offers you its intrinsic beauty but also glimpses of surrounding places so much to offer in one place.

        Covering an area of approximately 3128-hectare acres, this place is specifically one in KPK that is home to migrating birds and animals prone to extinction threat. The black bear and leopards dangle in common sight. Two species: Koklass Pheasant and Kalij Pheasant specifically subjected to extinction are found here. One's inner child and sense of adventure come into play upon adventure because it is surprising to witness such animals here. If you happen to be keen of hiking, tramp along the pipeline which leads to Dunga Gali after passing through Ayubia National Park. However, one must be sure since this 45-minute voyage can overwhelm with picturesque beauty of River Jhelum and hills dressed in pine.

    </div><br>
    <div class="description">
        This location finishes a league apart. Along the standards of valleys, one may not find anything like Shogran. It opens an array of awe-inspiring features, from flora and fauna to primeval surroundings, making it a heart of greenery in KPK. Shogran is hardly a destination for trekker and encourages constant sightseeing via local facilities provided here. In order to reach here safe and sound, heading from Islamabad and through Kawai is a viable option. However, one must be concerned about conditions of vehicles for commuting and also required to be driven by experienced personnel.

The term “thandiani” refers to “very cold”; no more can be said about the climate here. In summer, it is revived, colored green and altogether an alluring spot for anyone who wishes to see heaven on earth.</div>

        Ready to test your nerves and hardihood? The expense of witnessing the wonder of nature is strong willingness to contest the savage temperament welcoming any tourist here. But, it is all worthwhile when you are one of the few people to have magnificent pictures of this place in your camera. This area is most covered in snow, reaching via a tiring journey from Saif-ul-Malook. This place is worth the wreaking havoc in your nerves. Despite the difficulty, the impulse overwhelms almost every tourist and leaves no chance of canning this place. If you think you are a bit of travel fanatic then this place is ideal for you.
